You are alone in a city.
Atleast you think you are alone.
In a building somewhere, there is a man hidden with a sniper.

Do you want to scout him out from a distance, or smoke him out going door to door?
Choose player and weapon based on your preferred method.

PS: Sneakiness is better suited for a player with a sniper, but low sneakiness is easier to control.
